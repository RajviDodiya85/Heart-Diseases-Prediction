Heart Diseases Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Project Structure

- heart.csv : Dataset containing medical records of patients.
- heart_disease_classification.ipynb : Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model development.

Objective

The objective of this project is to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on a set of clinical features.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

- age  
- sex  
- chest pain type (cp)  
- resting blood pressure (trestbps)  
- cholesterol (chol)  
- fasting blood sugar (fbs)  
- resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)  
- maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)  
- exercise-induced angina (exang)  
- ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)  
- slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)  
- number of major vessels (ca)  
- thalassemia (thal)  
- target (0 = no heart disease, 1 = presence of heart disease)
